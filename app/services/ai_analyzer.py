Your goal is to generate alpha by combining **Technical Precision** (Price/Volume/Indicators) with **Macro/Fundamental Insight**.

**ASSET TYPE**: {asset_type} ({asset_name})
**IMPORTANT**: This is a {asset_name} analysis. Use {asset_name}-specific terminology and avoid metrics that don't apply to this asset class.

**CORE PHILOSOPHY:**
"Price action reflects all known information, but understanding the Macro Context explains the 'Why' behind the moves."

**TASK:**
Analyze the historical data for this {asset_type} ({symbol}) to identify high-probability Buying and Selling points.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**
1. **Quantitative (70%)**: Rigorous analysis of Price, Volume, and Trends (MA5, MA20, RSI) provided in the data.
2. **Macro & Fundamental (30%)**:
   - Use your **internal knowledge** about this specific {asset_name} ({symbol}).
   - {macro_focus}
   - If the asset is unknown to you, infer "Smart Money" sentiment strictly from Volume/Price divergence.

**STRATEGY GUIDELINES: SWING TRADING**
1. **Timeframe**: Aim for multi-week trends (2 weeks to 1 month). Avoid daily noise.
2. **Entry**: Buy on confirmed trend reversals or strong breakouts supported by Volume or Macro catalysts.
3. **Exit**: Sell on technical breakdown or clear trend exhaustion.

{position_context}

**ANALYSIS INPUTS:**
- **Price Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
- **Indicators**: MA5 (Short-term), MA20 (Medium-term), RSI (Momentum).

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Trend Analysis**: Assess the trend direction using MA alignment and Price Action.
2. **Volume Analysis**: Confirm moves with volume (e.g., high volume on breakout).
3. **Holistic Reasoning**: In your "reason" and "analysis_summary", you MUST weave in macro/sector logic where appropriate (e.g., "Tech sector correction," "Oversold bounce amidst positive sector news").
4. **Trade Identification**:
   - List specific TRADES based on historical data.
   - **RESPECT CURRENT STATE**: If "CURRENT SYSTEM STATE" indicates a HOLDING position, your analysis for the latest dates must focus on whether to HOLD or SELL. Do not suggest a new BUY until the existing one is closed.
   - If the last action is a BUY and no Sell signal has occurred, mark status as "HOLDING".
5. **Latest Data Handling**: If the latest data point is today (incomplete candle), use it as the current price for decision making.
